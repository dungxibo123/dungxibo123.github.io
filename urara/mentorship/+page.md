Hello, welcome to this note, my thoughts about mentorship. If you do not know who am I, please read my [about](/about-me) page.

## My early career

During my elementary and junior highschool, I focus on mathematics and advanced topics for gifted students at the same age. My lonely journey was so excited and suprisingly fun. I grew up in my major by mostly do anything alone, from searching for a source of mathematics, networking with other students in the fields and ask them for their sources, etc. Even in my early career in technology sector, I also solely rely on myself to learn new things without any help or guidance from the elders. I am the first ever in my family that going out their, follow the Information Technology. When standing between the options such as Web Development / Mobile / DevOps / Artificial Intelligence / etc, I have a large struggle to choose one since there is no advice from the one I can believe. So I have to try out everything, experienced the path and finally choose one. It take me around six months - with over 6 extra working hours a day - to produce a final decision. I think everything would be easier if I have a small guidance from the elders to follow.

## Mentorship


### My impression about mentorship
Since the time I was received into FPT AI Residency program at a 1st batch resident, I have a chance to work with great mentors. Although my mentors do not have so much experience in mentoring the youngstars in the field, but thanks for the chance to be under them, I see the potential of being advised by someone that have practical experience, supportive and always act as a role of the one who can answer my questions (even its dumb and stupid questions).

Not only in residency programs such as VinAI and FPT AI, the mentorship relationship happens everywhere in my connections, its just not have a legal name for the relationship between a senior student and a their junior, but I can obviously see the connections, guidances, support. Some projects was even born for connecting between the youngstars in the field  with a potential mentors with out any benefit (ProjectX, VEF,...)

For building the great organization, we not only need the great people currently working for it, but also need the younger ones to be trained for preparing to be a part of it. One said that "The best way to predict the future is to create it", like Barcelona, they have the best football academy for children. They raise the early starts from the technical to how they acting when being interviewed. 


### Personal perspective of mentorship

I was also a mentee, not by one but by two different mentors from FPT Software. None stop at that point, I consider many different people as my "mentor". With me, a mentor is someone that can give an advice for me when I have some trouble. My additional class' teacher from senior highschool is also "my mentor" (actually, I called him a teacher, bigger classes of mentor, I think). He is a very supportive person; although he can not answer all of my question regarding to advanced problem in mathematics but I always see his trying to find a document, find a person, ask elder students for my question, problem and answer back to me. 

Another person is my old boss at Be Group - Mr. Thanh Vuong. It was a luck to be work under his supervisor since he is play as a key role in my career's development. He was not going to teach me anything regarding to the technical side, he just throw me some advices, documents and answer or find someone can answer my question. As also, I also have his network if I need to find a jobs in the future.

### My mentee

Currently, I am actively supporting for two undergraduate students from Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. They are both great students and have a huge potential to become a expert in the field of technology, especially Artificial Intelligence. Everything start with a message with Bao, my first ever young brother, and Phuong - Bao's friend - also approach me and asking me whether I can give them some advices. Because I was never taught them anything, and also they have just some questions regarding to the technical stuffs, I personally never called them my mentee, they are both great bros and friends :)

They both are having the great journey since the first time I have a chat with each of them. Bao is actively looking for a Fresher/Junior level full time position in machine learning engineer. He is having a very good progress with Momo Talent Program. About Phuong, he just received the first ever offer from Zalo AI. Before joining Zalo and process for Momo, both Phuong and Bao just returned from 30-day internship at [NARA Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.naist.jp/en/) working on Naturual Language Processing.

### What am I receiving from my mentees?

Nearly ... nothing on the financial perspective or even technical perspective. However, helping them or giving advice on career is one of the greatest things I want to do for the young community - the resource of the future. So I do for nothing and non-profit, if one day you see me recruiting for mentee and the mentee have to pay for me - *THAT IS DEFINATELY NOT ME*.


### Do I receive new mentee?

Sadly, I do not have enough time for carefully planning the mentorship relationship. I have a lot of other things to do. But because I am an active person on answering the question from the young community, especially who are struggling with the future, do not know what to do next, I believe I can help or at least give an another perspective from my experience.

I am very appreciate that you are reading onto these last lines of the post, so I just want to share a thing with you. I always have a small desire that when I have enough reputation and available time, I will take one or two student and carefully instruct them as my mentee. As I said, I rarely have time to do that thing very carefully. But if you think you really want to be my "under", do not hestitate to contact me via my email address.
